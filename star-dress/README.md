# Dress-Up Game

## About This Project
This project is a fun, interactive dress-up game that I created to practice frontend development. It allows users to select a character and customize their outfit with various clothing items, accessories, and pets. All the assets used in the game are hand-drawn to add a personal touch and uniqueness to the experience.

- **React Router**: For managing page navigation.
- **CSS3**: For styling and animations.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and logic.
- **HTML5**: For structuring the UI elements.

## Features

- Background music and sound effects.
- A photo frame mode to showcase the final outfit.
